# 🎄 Advent of Code Solutions 2024 🎅

This repository houses my solutions for the annual Advent of Code challenge, a series of small programming puzzles released daily throughout December.
I aim to solve each puzzle efficiently and elegantly, focusing on clean code and robust logic.

| Day | Title           | Language | Status |
| --- | --------------- | -------- | ------ |
| 01  | Secret Entrance | Python   | Done   |
| 02  | Gift Shp        | Python   | Done   |

## 💻 Project Structure

Solutions are organized the day they correspond to. Each day typically has a dedicated folder containing the source code and the puzzle input file.

Day Folder: /dayXX/ (e.g., day01/)

Solution File: Contains the code for both Part 1 and Part 2.

Input File: Contains the specific input data for that day's puzzle.

```
.
├── day01/
│   ├── solution.py
│   └── input.txt
├── day02/
│   ├── solution.py
│   └── input.txt
├── ...
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt
```

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

Primary Language: Python 3.14+
Development Environment: VS Code / Terminal

The script will typically read the local input.txt file and print the answers for Part 1 and Part 2 to the console.
